# this file imports our graphql schema from multiple files.
# the order is important, do not change!
# we default to the generated schema prisma unless an override is specified
# to override a type, simply check the type name in the generated schema,
# then create that type again in either one of the Query or Mutation files, or your own file
# add your own imports at the end of the file like so: # import * from "./MyFile.graphql"

# import * from "./generated/prisma.graphql"
# import Query.*, * from "./Query.graphql"
# import Mutation.*, * from "./Mutation.graphql"
